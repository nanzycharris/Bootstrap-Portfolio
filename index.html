                        Similar to the fictional location of a short story written by a Latin-American author
                        representative
                        of
                        the
                        magical realism, Nancy Cantú Morúa was born in a dusty, barren, and uncharismatic town on the
                        northern
                        border of Mexico, on the south side of the Rio Grande.

                        The first of four children that the marriage of Lupita Morua, a dressmaker, and Mercedes
                        Cantu,
                        a
                        restaurant
                        waiter, produced, Nancy grew up Catholic, watching overdramatic actors and simplistic plots
                        from
                        telenovelas
                        with her mother, and reading with her father about history and science from the various
                        encyclopedias
                        proudly displayed in their living room bookcase.

                        Raised Catholic, Nancy took her first communion in her elementary school years. She didn’t have
                        a
                        quinceañera, instead, she asked for a family trip. In lieu of a grand celebration, her parents
                        packed
                        the
                        family in their used white Ford Aerostar, and decided to invite her maternal grandmother,
                        step-grandfather,
                        and as many uncles and aunts as they could fit in the vehicle, and drove for what seemed an
                        eternity
                        but
                        was
                        only a couple of hours to the lackluster beach of Matamoros on her 15th birthday.

                There was no cake, or mariachis to sing Las Mañanitas to her, no one even remembered to say
                “Feliz
                cumpleaños” to her. Paradoxically, she’s thankful for those memories and she credits them with
                giving
                her
                the strength and determination to graduate college.

                Nancy worked and saved for two years after high school so that she could move to Monterrey at
                the
                age of
                19
                to attend college at the Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon. Holding at times two jobs and a
                full
                load
                of
                credits every semester and summer, our petite light skin, brown eyed girl managed to obtain her
                B.A.
                in
                Communications with a 3.64 GPA.
            </p>
            <p>
                After college, Nancy worked as a writer and news reporter for several printed, electronic, and
                digital
                media
                outlets in her hometown of Reynosa and Monterrey. She found moderate success in her field and
                never
                again
                went to bed with hunger pains.

                In 2009, our subject changed trajectories and came to live in the United States after marrying
                James
                Harris,
                from Garland, Texas. Nancy stopped being Cantú Morúa to become Cantu Harris, and in 2012 she
                gave
                birth
                to a
                daughter they named Teresa after Mother Teresa.

                In recent years, Nancy C. Harris has enjoyed overcoming a severe depression, and a bad marriage,
                both
                probably related. She currently works as a Spanish teacher for children 2-5 years old at a
                private
                Christian
                school in south Dallas, and loves taking technology classes and reading books in English and
                Spanish
                with
                her daughter Teresa at bedtime.
